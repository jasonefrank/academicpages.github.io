I am a mathematician, instructor and Head of the Department of Mathematics and the Mathematical Institute in the Faculty of Science of Utrecht University.  I teach courses on Mathematical Modelling and the Mathematics of Complex Systems.  My research combines numerical analysis and computational mathematics, dynamical systems, and multiscale modelling and data assimilation. I am interested in applications of mathematics in atmosphere/ocean/climate science, earth and life sciences and economics.
