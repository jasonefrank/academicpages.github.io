I am a mathematician, instructor and Head of the Department of Mathematics and the Mathematical Institute in the Faculty of Science of Utrecht University.  I teach courses on Mathematical Modelling and the Mathematics of Complex Systems.  My research combines numerical analysis and computational mathematics, dynamical systems, and multiscale modelling and data assimilation. I am interested in applications of mathematics in atmosphere/ocean/climate science, earth and life sciences and economics.

Research Interests
======
- Numerical methods for time-dependent ordinary and partial differential equations, in particular geometric integration and 
(multi-)symplectic discretizations of Hamiltonian PDEs, mimetic and structure preserving methods. Application to atmosphere and ocean science.
- Data assimilation and parameter estimation: synchronization and tangent space decomposition methods, minimax optimal control approach, and particle methods. Geophysical fluid dynamics context.
- Stochastic-dynamic thermostat methods for control/correction of invariant densities and modelling of underresolved processes.
- Multiscale modelling, homogenization, stochastic parameterization.
- Complex systems science: dynamics on networks, synchronization, transitions. Applications in economics and finance, biology, technology.
